# Game of Life

## Overview

This project is an implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the life cycle of cells. It is built with HTML, JavaScript, and Vite as the build tool for a faster development experience. Users can interact with the game by setting initial cell states on a grid and watching the cells evolve over time according to a set of rules. The project also includes functionality to start, stop, and reset the game.

## Features

- Interactive grid to set initial state of cells.
- "Start" button to begin the simulation.
- "Restart" button to reset the game and create new patterns.
- Canvas-based rendering for better performance and visual appeal.
